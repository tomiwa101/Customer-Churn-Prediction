# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Competition is tough in the market where customers are free to choose from plenty of providers even within one product category. Several bad experiences – or even one – and a customer may quit. And if droves of unsatisfied customers churn at a clip, both material losses and damage to reputation would be enormous.

My main goal in this project is to build a model to predict customer's behaviour (i.e customers that would churn) which the business team can use to develop focused customer retention programs that stop this churning. Other objectives include:
* Extract insight that could help improve the business in the future

# Procedure
1. Descriptive statistics of the dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (uni & multivariate analysis)
3. Data processing

Description on which predictive method to use (e.g linear regression) at least 2 need to be included. Build and evaluate the models, compare
their performance, interpret the models using Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn

4. Construction of predictive features
5. Baseline method
6. Hyper-parameter tuning
7. Model evaluation
